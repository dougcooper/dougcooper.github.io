After installing opkg and attempting to setup avahi-daemon, I managed to put the KK into an unrecoverable state. Specifically, when the device powered on the blue LED would be constant for ~20sec then go out, followed by a constant amber (or red) LED and a relay click. At this point the relay was closed allowing power but I was not able to manually open/close the relay via the button nor was I able to successfully reset to the factory settings. This is where [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DouglasCooper/posts/gKY3RTwfP3V) really came to the rescue and I've outlined detailed steps below.
